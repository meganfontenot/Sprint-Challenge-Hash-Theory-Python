1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

Regular Expression: A method of matching/finding sequences of characters or 'bytes' in a given piece of text. Regex uses a library with methods like search(), findall(), and match() to take a regular expression and the content the said expression to search or match through.

2. What is an array and how does it work?

An array or a 'list' is a container that holds a fixed number of elements that can access the value of these elements by using its index.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

HashTables use index's as keys to store unique information into separate buckets- compacting the data. bc of this, collisions can occur. Managing this requires us to use linked list to store our hash table values. So if a collision occurs, a new node can be formed on the linked list to save the additional value instead of over writing the array.
